== What does it do? ==

Get all contacts from SugarCRM via its soap interface,
empty a specific contacts folder of a Zimbra user, and re-fill it using
the Zimbra REST interface.

Urls, account, folder, etc are of course configurable.

Includes a debug mode that doesn't really touch your Zimbra data, only says
what it would do.


== Dependencies ==
* php commandline interpreter
* curl
* nusoap library shipped with sugar (included)
* zmprov [*]

[*] zmprov is part of zimbra, so you'll probably run this on the machine that runs zimbra.
    the sugar machine can be different, as long as you have access to it's soap interface.

== known issues ==
* Memory usage is not optimal as it is. (we use the huge dataset at once).
Play with php's memory_limit setting, we need about 400MB for 500 contacts.
